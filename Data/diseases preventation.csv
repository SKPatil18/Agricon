Diseases_Name,Precautions
Apple_scab,"1. Choose scab-resistant varieties of apple or crabapple trees.
2. Rake up and discard any fallen leaves or fruit on a regular basis, and never leave fallen leaves or fruit on the ground over winter. Apple scab fungus overwinters on fallen leaves and fruit.
3. Prune your apple and crabapple trees to keep their crowns open so light and air can move through. Dry leaves and fruit help to prevent initial infection.
4. Plant your apple and crabapple trees correctly, in full sun and with enough space around each tree, according to their mature size. Shade keeps water from evaporating quickly, and crowded trees are more susceptible to the disease.
5. Irrigate your trees in the early morning hours, and don’t use overhead sprays that will wet leaves and fruit. Dry leaves won’t host the fungus."
Black_rot,"While you do have the option to start spraying a fungicide now to try to slow down disease progression, at this point in the season, it probably won't help much in salvaging the rest of the fruit for this year. However, taking the time to remove as much of the infected material this year as you can will make a big difference. Then start in with a good spray program early next year and you should be able to get good disease control."
Cedar_apple_rust,"1. Tolerate leaf spots and fruit infection on apples, hawthorns, serviceberry and other plants in the Rosaceae family. They do not significantly affect the health of the tree if leaf loss does not occur.
2. Do not plant eastern red cedar and juniper plants within a few hundred yards of susceptible Rosaceae plants. This will reduce diseases problems but not completely eliminate them.
3. Inspect nearby juniper and red cedar trees in late winter or early spring. Prune and remove brown, woody galls found before orange, gelatinous structures form in the spring. This will help reduce the level of infection on nearby Rosaceae plants.
4. Prune and remove infected twigs or branches on Rosaceae plants if they occur."
Esca_(Black_Measles)," Remove the infected berries, leaves and trunk and destroy them. Protect the prune wounds to minimize fungal infection using wound sealant (5% boric acid in acrylic paint) or essential oil or suitable fungicides."
Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot),"blights typically involve the destruction of the infected plant parts; use of disease-free seed or stock and resistant varieties; crop rotation; pruning and spacing of plants for better air circulation; controlling pests that carry the fungus from plant to plant; avoidance of overhead watering and working among wet plants; and, where needed, the application of fungicide or antibiotics. Proper sanitation is key to stop the spread of the infestation. For bacterial blights (e.g., fire blight), fixed copper or streptomycin is an effective antibiotic if applied weekly during damp weather when leaves and shoots are expanding"
Bacterial_spot,"Copper-containing fungicides (active ingredients like copper octanoate, basic copper sulfate, or copper diammonium diacetate complex) have the benefit of protecting plants from leaf spots caused by bacteria as well as fungi."
Early_blight,Tomatoes that have early blight require immediate attention before the disease takes over the plants. Thoroughly spray the plant (bottoms of leaves also) with Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide concentrate or Bonide Tomato & Vegetable. Both of these treatments are organic.
Late_blight,"Use fungicide sprays based on mandipropamid, chlorothalonil, fluazinam, mancozeb to combat late blight. Fungicides are generally needed only if the disease appears during a time of year when rain is likely or overhead irrigation is practiced."
Leaf_Mold,"Recommended compounds in field use are chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb and copper formulations. For greenhouses, difenoconazole, mandipropamid, cymoxanil, famoxadone and cyprodinil are recommended."
Septoria_leaf_spot,"Fungicides containing maneb, mancozeb, chlorothalonil effectively control Septoria leaf spot."
Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite,"Use Doktor Doom Spider Mite Knockout, Neem Oil, Diatomaceous Earth."
Target_Spot,"Products containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and copper oxychloride have been shown to provide good control of target spot in research trials."
YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus,"Use a neonicotinoid insecticide, such as dinotefuran (Venom) imidacloprid (AdmirePro, Alias, Nuprid, Widow, and others) or thiamethoxam (Platinum), as a soil application or through the drip irrigation system at transplanting of tomatoes or peppers."
mosaic_virus,"1.Mosaic viruses are mostly spread by insects, especially aphids and leafhoppers. You can try covering your plants with a floating row cover or aluminum foil mulches to prevent these insects from infecting your plants. 
2. Control your weeds. Some types may serve as hosts for the disease, and when aphids and other insects feed on these plants, they will spread the viruses to your garden plants.
3. To avoid seed-borne mosaic viruses, soak seeds of susceptible plants in a 10% bleach solution before planting."
Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot,"Fungicides, if sprayed early in season before initial damage, can be effective in reducing disease."
Common_rust,"Products containing mancozeb, pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + metconazole, pyraclostrobin + fluxapyroxad, azoxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole can be used to control the disease."
Northern_Leaf_Blight,The spray schedule should start when the first lesions appear on the leaf below the ear on 50% of the plants. Applications made at tasseling or silking (VT/R1) provide the most consistent results in terms of disease control and yield response
Potato___Early_blight,Mancozeb and chlorothalonil are perhaps the most frequently used protectant fungicides for early blight management but provide insufficient control under high disease pressure.
Potato___Late_blight,The severe late blight can be effectively managed with prophylactic spray of mancozeb at 0.25% followed by cymoxanil+mancozeb or dimethomorph+mancozeb at 0.3% at the onset of disease and one more spray of mancozeb at 0.25% seven days after application of systemic fungicides
